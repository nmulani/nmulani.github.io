The *this* property in Javascript is kind of quirky - whenever a function executes, it is assigned a *this* property, which is a variable which contains the value of the object that invokes the function in which *this* is used.

An example of the kind of context in which *this* might be used:

```javascript

var state = {     name:  "Illinois",
                        capital: "Springfield",

                        printDetails: function(){
                        console.log("The capital of " + this.name + " is " + this.capital);
                        }
                   }

// running state.printDetails() should print: The capital of Illinois is Springfield

```
